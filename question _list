| --------------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Recreate        | High     | Manual   | Low        | Low     |
| Rolling         | Low      | Hard     | Medium     | Medium  |
| Blue-Green      | None     | Easy     | Medium     | High    |
| Canary          | None     | Easy     | High       | Medium  |
| A/B Testing     | None     | Hard     | High       | Medium  |

2. What is artifact Repo?
Ans - An Artifact Repository is a centralized storage location where compiled code (also called artifacts) like .jar, .war, .zip, .tar.gz, .deb, .rpm, Docker images, and more are stored and managed for use in deployments.

3. How will you trace back to the source code when all team members are changed ?
✅ 1. Check the Git Repository (Version Control System)
✅ 2. Look at Branching and Tagging
✅ 3. Review CI/CD Pipelines
✅ 4. Trace Artifacts to Commits
✅ 5. Use Ticketing System Integration
✅ 6. Explore Infrastructure as Code & Docs
✅ 7. Audit Logs & Access Logs
✅ 8. Reverse Engineer if Needed

| Stage       | Security Practices                              |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Code**    | Linting, SAST, secret scanning                  |
| **Build**   | Dependency scanning, artifact signing           |
| **Test**    | DAST, container scanning, test coverage reports |
| **Release** | Signed artifacts, change approvals              |
| **Deploy**  | Role-based access, infra-as-code hardening      |
| **Operate** | Logging, monitoring, patch management, MFA      |
